 * An audio module subclass whose audio processing callback is to be implemented
 * in Java (as opposed to native code).
 * 
 * THIS IS NOT THE RECOMMENDED WAY TO USE PATCHFIELD. The Java processing callback
 * cannot be invoked on a real-time thread and Java code is prone to garbage
 * collection breaks. This means that instances of this class run a higher risk
 * of missing their deadlines and causing dropouts than audio modules that do
 * their processing natively. Use this class for quick-and-dirty prototypes,
 * but not for any serious applications that require glitch-free performance.
